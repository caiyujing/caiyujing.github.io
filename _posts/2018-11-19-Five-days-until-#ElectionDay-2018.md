With five days left until Election Day in the US, we want to share an update on our efforts to ensure that Twitter provides a healthy space for public conversation that voters can rely on for accurate election news and information.

This has already been the most Tweeted-about US midterm election ever. Since October 1, people have sent more than 10 million Tweets about voting and early voting (15,000 US users even have ‘vote’ in their display name!)

Over the last several months, we’ve taken significant steps to safeguard the integrity of conversations surrounding the US elections by reducing the spread of disinformation, strengthening outreach to government stakeholders, and streamlining our enforcement processes. We are committed to serving the public conversation about elections on our platform. Examples of this include our [ongoing health initiatives](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/Serving_Healthy_Conversation.html), political party and state election official education and dedicated reporting routes, and empowering further[ research of our information operations](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/enabling-further-research-of-information-operations-on-twitter.html).

We launched our [#BeAVoter campaign](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/be-a-voter-2018.html) in September to promote increased, informed participation in the 2018 US midterms. To date, Twitter has added nearly 1,000 [election labels](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/introducing-us-election-labels-for-midterm-candidates.html)to candidates’ profiles and partnered with local television stations across the country to livestream 32 House, Senate and gubernatorial debates on Twitter. In comparison to 2016, the number of people who Tweeted about #NationalVoterRegistrationDay has also doubled.

Starting today, Twitter is launching a wave of new #BeAVoter campaign initiatives to build on those efforts and encourage eligible voters to participate in next week’s elections.

People on Twitter in the US will see an Election Day countdown in their home timeline with information on how to find their polling place and who is on their ballot via [GetToThePolls.com](https://gettothepolls.com/), an initiative of the [Voting Information Project (VIP)](https://votinginfoproject.org/).

We are also launching a [#BeAVoter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23BeAVoter&src=typeahead_click) video campaign with influential young voices on Twitter to leverage their reach and encourage young people to educate themselves about which candidates will appear on their ballot, as well as show up to the polls on Election Day.
